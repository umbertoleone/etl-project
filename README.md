# ETL Project
## A Glance into Politics and Macroeconomics 
Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) project that performs data integration process on two datsets, namely 2016 US Presidential Results by County and US Unemployment Rate by County 1990-2016.

## 1. Extraction
	Datasets were downloaded from kaggle.com as detailed below. All datasets are available in csv file format and one is available in json format too. Datasets have different ways of naming states, by name and by abbreviation. We scraped a table of states with their names and abbreviations from infoplease.com and 50states.com, and we decided to use infoplease because it had the American territories.
